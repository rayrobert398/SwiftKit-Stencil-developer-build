# StencilSwiftKit CHANGELOG

---

## 2.10.0

### Breaking Changes

* With the Stencil update, we're deprecating our `StencilSwiftTemplate` template class which contained a workaround that's no longer needed. It will also no longer be set by default by the `stencilSwiftEnvironment` builder.  
  [David Jennes](https://github.com/djbe)
  [#159](https://github.com/SwiftGen/StencilSwiftKit/pull/159)
* With the Stencil update, we're deprecating our `removeNewlines` filter, as this can now be achieved by the built-in Stencil syntax.  
  [David Jennes](https://github.com/djbe)
  [#159](https://github.com/SwiftGen/StencilSwiftKit/pull/159)

### New Features

* Updated to Stencil 0.15.0, which contains many improvements, chief amongst them is whitespace behaviour control.  
  [David Jennes](https://github.com/djbe)
  [#159](https://github.com/SwiftGen/StencilSwiftKit/pull/159)

  [David Jennes](https://github.com/djbe)
  [#111](https://github.com/SwiftGen/StencilSwiftKit/pull/111)
* The `swiftIdentifier` now supports a `valid` mode, where it will do the bare minimum to get a valid identifier. I.e. it will not change the case of characters at all (compared to `normal` mode).  
  [David Jennes](https://github.com/djbe)
  [#160](https://github.com/SwiftGen/StencilSwiftKit/pull/160)

## 1.0.1

### Internal Changes

* Switch from Travis CI to Circle CI, clean up the Rakefile in the process.  
  [David Jennes](https://github.com/djbe)
  [#20](https://github.com/SwiftGen/StencilSwiftKit/issues/20)
  [#25](https://github.com/SwiftGen/StencilSwiftKit/issues/25)
* Fixed SPM dependency in `Package.swift`.  
  [Krzysztof Zabłocki](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki)
  [#26](https://github.com/SwiftGen/StencilSwiftKit/pull/26/files)

## 1.0.0

### New Features

* Added support for Swift Package Manager.  
  [Krzysztof Zabłocki](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki)
  [#15](https://github.com/SwiftGen/StencilSwiftKit/issues/15)
* Added `MapNode` to apply a `map` operator to an array.
  You can now use `{% map someArray into result using item %}`
  to do the equivalent of the `result = someArray.map { item in … }` Swift code.  
  [David Jennes](https://github.com/djbe)
  [#11](https://github.com/SwiftGen/StencilSwiftKit/pull/11)
* Add a "parameters parser" able to transform parameters passed as a set of strings
  (`a=1 b.x=2 b.y=3 c=4 c=5`) — typically provided as the command line arguments of a CLI
   — into a Dictionary suitable for Stencil contexts.  
  [David Jennes](https://github.com/djbe)
  [#8](https://github.com/SwiftGen/StencilSwiftKit/pull/8)
* Add a `StencilContext.enrich` function to enrich Stencil contexts with `param` and `env` dictionaries.  
  The `param` dictionary typically contains parameters parsed via the parameters parser above.  
  The `env` dictionary contains all the environment variables. You can thus access them in
  your templates using `env.USER`, `env.LANG`, `env.PRODUCT_MODULE_NAME`, etc.  
  [#19](https://github.com/SwiftGen/StencilSwiftKit/pull/19)

### Internal Changes

* Renamed `SwiftTemplate` to `StencilSwiftTemplate`.  
  [David Jennes](https://github.com/djbe)
  [#14](https://github.com/SwiftGen/StencilSwiftKit/issues/14)
* Refactor stencil swift extensions registration for easier use with an existing `Extension`.  
  [David Jennes](https://github.com/djbe)
  [#16](https://github.com/SwiftGen/StencilSwiftKit/issues/16)
* Refactor stencil node tests to not use templates and output files.  
  [David Jennes](https://github.com/djbe)
  [#17](https://github.com/SwiftGen/StencilSwiftKit/issues/17)
